## Test 2
Last updated Jan 26nd 2022, Will Eaton, Princeton University

### Current test results:

##### Self gravitating:
- Both NMSYN and YSPEC results are given for the self-gravitating example. 
- Same pattern is observed as in Test 1 in which the results agree except for minor variations on the theta channel  
- Results are shown in selfgrav_att_results.pdf 

##### Cowling approximation: 
- As with Test 1, only YSPEC is used here.
- Still waiting on results for this simulation for SPECFEMX

### Test description and Inputs:
- All inputs/model parameters are identical to as in Test 1 except that attenuation is turned on.
- Implementing attenuation in easy as it is just one switch, but NMSYN requires new catalogues. The inputs folder here therefore contains the new catalogue material as well as the attenuating model for YSPEC
